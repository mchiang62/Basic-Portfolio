    <p>I am from Memphis, TN. I went to school at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville and 
        received my Bachelor's degree in 2017. I have been working in the Accounting field for 2 years and 
     seeking for a new career in the tech industry</p>
        
        <p>I enjoy running, and I have been lifting consistently for 7 weeks now.
            I am also looking for some new hobbies.
